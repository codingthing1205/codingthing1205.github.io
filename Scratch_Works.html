			<p> So how you play is that 1 person uses the q and a keys to move the player up and down, and the other person uses the up and down arrow keys to move up and down. The puck will move aroud the table and you have to use the keys to prevent the puck to get in your goal. If the puck gets in your goal the other player gets a point. When a player gets 10 points the speed of the puck will get faster! When someone gets 20 points it will show "Player 2 Wins!" or "Player 1 Wins!" then the game is over.  </p> <font size="3">

				<td> <font size="3"> <u> If color touching this... </u> One part of the coding is "If color touching this" it means if one thing is touching a color then something specific would happen. <p> <u> Broadcast... </u> Another part of the coding is "broadcast" broadcast is basically like a message, if you say "broadcast You Lose!." You could make a sprite disappear or appear by putting "when I recieve message." </p> </font> </td>

		    <p> You don't play this project, you watch it! This project is an animation! The animation is just images that are getting colored in, one section at a time. The theme to the animation is St Patricks Day! Because it is almost March. After one picture is finished another one will start being colored in, the whole animation is 3 pictures. After the pictures finish getting colored in, the animation it will end. </p> </font> </td>

				<td> <font size="3"> <u> Backdrops... </u> One part of the coding for the animation is the backdrops, the backdrops are like the stages. You could make backdrops that have the same picture and just progress with the color. For example you could fill in a color like red in one backdrop, and in the next one you could fill in red <u> and </u> orange. <p> <u> Next backdrop... </u> "next backdrop" is the block that switches the backdrops to one to an another. So it allows the backdrops to look like an animation! </p> </font> </td>

			<p> First when you play this game you see a <u> blank</u> pumpkin. But you also see 2 different kinds of mouths and noses. This game you decorate your own pumpkin! You can click one mouth and one nose together. And it makes a jack-o-lantern! You can do whatever kind of jack-o-lantern you want. You're the one who's designing it. But if you don't like your pumpkin with a certain kind of nose or mouth, you can always clear the jakc-o-lantern by clicking the red clear button, and make your jack-o-lantern <u> blank</u> pumpkin again. </p> </font> </td>
</td>

				<td> <font size="3"> <u> Hide... </u> One part of this game's coding is "hide" when you use the hide block, it'll make the sprite (a sprite is kind of like a character) disappear. I used this block to make the clear button work. So the mouths and noses would hide when the clear button was pressed. </p> <u> Show... </u> "show" is what makes the mouths and noses appear on the pumpkin. You use this block to show a sprite after it's been "hidden" by the "hide" block. </p> </font> </td>

			<p> This game is The Impossible Quiz. You play by answering the questions that it asks you. You drag the arrow to your answer and wait. If you get it right, you go to the next question, but if you get it wrong, it'll say WRONG! And you'll lose a life. You have 5 lives. And there are 3 questions. When you answer all of the questions it'll say... YOU WIN! </p> </font> </td>
</td>

				<td> <font size="3"> <u> Variables... </u> A part of this code, is the variables. The coding for your lives is variables. You do the subject, and then you could put how many of the subject that you want. You can put 10 points, or even 6,000 shoes! Whatever you want, You could also make the variable show on the screen or hide it. </p> <u> Change by <u>   </u> ... </u> "change ___ by __" changes the number of things that you put on the subject, you could increase the number or decrease the number to increase it you say change by a positive number. To decrease it you put change by a negative number. </p> </font> </td>
